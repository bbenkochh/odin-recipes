        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Scallion Pancakes, traditionally called Cong you bing, are made from dough instead of batter like Western pancakes. Chewy, flaky, and savory the pancakes are folded with oil and scallions or green onions!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Pancakes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for working surface</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/3 cup chicken fat warmed, or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 bunches scallions, thinly slices (about 2 cups)</li>
                <li>8 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, plus for brushing</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4> Pancakes</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk 2½ cups flour and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Mix in sesame oil and 1 cup boiling water with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                <li>Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking, until dough is smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover; let rest at room temperature 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 8 pieces. Working with one at a time, roll out on a lightly floured work surface as thin as possible (each should be approximately 10" in diameter). Brush about 2 tsp. chicken fat on dough and top with about ¼ cup scallions; season with salt. Roll dough away from you (like a jelly roll) into a thin cylinder, then, starting at 1 end, wind roll onto itself to create a coil (like a cinnamon roll). Cover and repeat with remaining dough. Let rest at room temperature 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Working with 1 coil at a time, roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 5" round (keep other coils covered). Repeat with remaining dough and stack as you go, separating with parchment or lightly greased foil brushed with vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-low. Working with one at a time, cook pancake, turning frequently to prevent scallions from burning, until golden brown and crisp on both sides and cooked through, 8–10 minutes. Transfer pancakes to a wire rack and let rest about 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sugar, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Serve alongside pancakes for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
